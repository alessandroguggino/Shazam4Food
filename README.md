# Shazam For Food

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-swag.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

The Shazam app but it's for food. More or less.
<br>
An idea **shamelessly copied** from SeeFood, the Jian Yang app from TV series Silicon Valley S4E3, and <a href="https://github.com/imtoori">@imtoori</a>'s project. 

So, what have I done? I've just made it a little more *italian*, detecting pizzas instead of hot-dogs.

This project is a mobile app developed with Flutter and FirebaseML.
