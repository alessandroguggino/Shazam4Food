# Shazam For Food

The Shazam app but it's for food. More or less.
<br>
An idea **shamelessly copied** from SeeFood, the Jian Yang app from TV series Silicon Valley S4E3, and [@imtoori](https://github.com/imtoori)'s project. 

So, what I've done? I've just made it a little more *italian*.

This project is a mobile app developed with Flutter and FirebaseML.
